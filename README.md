# Machine Learning Regression on Raman SERS Spectroscopy Data

## Project Summary

This project applies advanced machine learning regression techniques to predict chemical analyte concentrations from high-resolution Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) data. The objective is to explore model robustness and accuracy when interpreting complex spectral patterns, particularly in settings where analytical precision is critical — such as pharmaceutical quality control or chemical sensing applications.

By evaluating multiple regression models on the same dataset, this project aims to establish a scalable workflow for integrating ML into modern chemometrics pipelines.

## Objective

To design, implement, and compare multiple regression algorithms that can accurately learn the mapping between SERS spectral intensities and target concentration values. The overarching goal is to identify the most reliable and generalizable model that can be deployed in practical spectroscopy-based quantification tasks.

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Input**: Raman SERS spectra (experimental or simulated)
- **File Format**: CSV
- **Features**: Raman intensity values across wavenumber ranges
- **Target Variable**: Analyte concentration (denoted as `Conc`)

Each row represents a sample spectrum. The model must interpret the spectral signature and estimate the corresponding chemical concentration.

| Model                  | Description                                                       | Notebook             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Linear Regression      | Baseline linear model for reference                              | `01_linear.ipynb`    |
| Polynomial Regression  | Nonlinear model using polynomial feature expansion               | `02_poly.ipynb`      |
| Lasso Regression (L1)  | Sparse model with built-in feature selection                     | `03_lasso.ipynb`     |
| Ridge Regression (L2)  | Shrinkage model to reduce overfitting on high-dimensional data   | `04_ridge.ipynb`     |

All models follow a consistent pipeline to ensure fair comparison.

## Workflow Pipeline

1. Load spectral data from CSV
2. Preprocess: missing value handling, normalization, scaling
3. Train-test split (typically 80-20)
4. Model training on training set
5. Predictions on test set
6. Evaluation using regression metrics
7. Visualization of actual vs. predicted values
8. Model comparison based on accuracy, generalization, and residual analysis

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, the following metrics are calculated:

- **R² Score**: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average magnitude of absolute prediction errors
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors, sensitive to outliers

Each model is assessed on these metrics and compared in a unified results table.

---

## Output Visualizations

Each notebook provides:

- Actual vs Predicted scatter plots
- Residual error distributions
- Metric summary tables

These visual tools provide insight into both model accuracy and behavior.

## Dependencies and Tools

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` for all regression models

---

## Future Extensions

- Integrate Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Deep learning models (e.g., MLP or CNN for raw spectra)
- Spectral preprocessing: smoothing, denoising, baseline correction
- PCA or t-SNE for feature reduction and visualization
- Robustness tests using noise-injected spectra

## Why This Matters

Raman spectroscopy is fast, non-destructive, and highly sensitive — but interpreting its data accurately often requires expert chemometric techniques. This project builds a foundation for enabling real-time, automated concentration prediction using machine learning models, enhancing the value of SERS in analytical chemistry and beyond.
